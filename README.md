**Good Luck, Wizard**. You're going to need it. Especially because this is an
_extremely_ unfinished game. It's hard to even call it a game at this point. You
should come back later when there's something worth playing.

**If you absolutely must try it, you can install it** with `gem install
good_luck_wizard` and run it with `glw`. This assumes you have a working Ruby
environment and a new enough version of Ruby.

**This project is not seeking contributions,** but bug reports are accepted [on
GitHub](https://github.com/jarednorman/good_luck_wizard).

**This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration.**
Everyone interacting in the _Good Luck, Wizard_ projectâ€™s codebases, issue
trackers, chat rooms and mailing lists is expected to follow the [code of
conduct](https://github.com/jarednorman/good_luck_wizard/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

**To run thep roject locally,** checck out the repo and run `bin/setup` to
install dependencies. The tests are run with `bundle exec rspec`. You can also
run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then
run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version,
push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
