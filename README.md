**good Luck, wizard**. you're going to need it. not least of all because this is
an _extremely_ unfinished game. not really a game at all, yet. come back later.

if you absolutely must try it, you can install it with `gem install
good_luck_wizard` and run it with `glw`. this assumes you have a working Ruby
environment and a new enough version of Ruby.

this project is not seeking contributions, but bug reports are accepted [on
GitHub](https://github.com/jarednorman/good_luck_wizard).

this project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration. yes,
even though i don't want you to contribute, i will still ensure you aren't
descriminated against if you try. everyone interacting in the _good luck,
wizard_ project’s codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms and mailing lists is
expected to follow the [code of
conduct](https://github.com/jarednorman/good_luck_wizard/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

to run the project locally: check out the repo and run `bin/setup` to install
dependencies. the tests are run with `bundle exec rspec`. you can also run
`bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
